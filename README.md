The first data set I received as a brand new analyst was pretty challenging. I had almost 8,000 lines of records, most packed into single columns. 
I needed single record rows, with individual variable data in columns. 
Searching for a way to automate it, I didn't quite find anything described in typical practices that fit my needs.
With more digging though, I discovered the steps I needed to use to do most of the work in Python, using split().
Thanks for reading and I value any feedback!
